# ASL_Detection

To run this application, run app.py using either asl_model55.pth weights (for the normal model) or asl_model56.pth weights (for the background cropping model). There may some code that you need to comment out in app.py or comment in for either to work (the part where in the code where it does the background cropping). Also, if you wish to use the ChatGPT and the TTS feature (Play.HT), you will need to get API keys for both of them. Mine is listed, but since the code is on github, the keys will no longer work.

For some reason, some of the data has been ommited from the display here on the github site, however, all of them are still in the github server (Apparently there is a limit of 1000 files for display whereas my folders have around 1700 per file in some cases)
These truncated folders include "cropped_training_pics/", and "new_data"
To find these files, clone the repository. 
For example enter this into your command prompt: git clone https://github.com/AmoghKhaparde/ASL_Detection.git

This will load the images on your computer, and you will be able to see all the files.
